# Leetcode
**Day1**
First Question(TwoSum)-Easy
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
 You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 
 Second Question(Palindrome Number)-Easy
 Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
 
 Third Question(AddTwoNumbers)-Medium
 You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
 
 Fourth Question(Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)-Medium
 Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 
**** Day2****
First Question(Median of Two Sorted Arrays)-Hard
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Second Question(Regular Expression Matching)-Hard
Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

***Day3***
First Question(Longest Palindromic Substring)-Medium
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Second Question-(Reverse Integer)-Medium
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0

Third Question-(Merge Two Sorted Lists)-Easy
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

Fourth Question-(Remove Element)-Easy
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

***Day4***
First Question-(Merge k Sorted Lists)-Hard
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.
