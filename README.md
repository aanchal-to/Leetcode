# Leetcode
**Day1**
First Question(TwoSum)-Easy
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
 You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 
 Second Question(Palindrome Number)-Easy
 Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
 
 Third Question(AddTwoNumbers)-Medium
 You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
 
 Fourth Question(Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)-Medium
 Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 
**** Day2****
First Question(Median of Two Sorted Arrays)-Hard
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
